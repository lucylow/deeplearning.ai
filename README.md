# Notes for deeplearning.ai
Andrew Ng's deeplearning.ai course notes

**Course Projects**
* Car Detection: using YOLOv2, one of the most effective object detection algorithms, to detect cars and other objects.
* Art Generation: using a neural style transfer algorithm, you will combine the content of one image with the style of another to create a new piece of art.
* Facial Recognition: to build a  facial verification and recognition system to automatically tag images.
